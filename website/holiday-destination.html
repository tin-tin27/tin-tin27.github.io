  <p><h4>
   <ul> <li><b>Cox's Bazar:</b><br>
    Miles of golden sands, towering cliffs, surfing waves, rare conch shells, colorful pagodas,
     Buddhist temples and tribes, delightful sea-food--this is cox's bazar, the tourist capital of Bangladesh. Having <b>the world's longest (120 kilometers)</b> beach sloping gently down to the blue waters of the Bay of Bengal, 
    Cox's Bazar is one of the most attractive tourist sport in the country.</li>
    <br>
     <li><b>Kuakata sea beach:</b><br>
     known as the "Daughter of the Sea," is a beautiful 
    beach in the southernmost part of Bangladesh. It is the only beach
     in South Asia where the sunrise and sunset can be seen standing. It is undoubtedly an excellent way to see
     the sun shining in the sea's belly and to see the sun disappearing on the ocean.</li>
     <br>
     <li><b>St. Martins Island:</b> <br>
     This small coral island about 10km (6mi) south-west of the southern tip of the mainland is a tropical clich√©, 
     with beaches fringed with coconut palms and bountiful marine life. There''s nothing more strenuous to do here than soak up the rays,
      but it''s a clean and 
     peaceful place without even a mosquito to disrupt your serenity.</li>
</ul></h4></p>

  <p><h4>Nestled in the picturesque Surma Valley amidst scenic tea plantations and lush green tropical forests, 
    greater Sylhet is a prime attraction for all tourists visiting Bangladesh. Laying between the Khasia and 
    the Jaintia hills on the north, and the Tripura hills on the south, Sylhet breaks the monotony of the flatness of this land
     by a multitude of terraced tea gardens, rolling countryside and the exotic flora and fauna.
      Here the thick tropical forests abound with many species of wildlife, spread their aroma around the typical hearth and 
      homes of the Mainpuri Tribal maidens famous for their dance.

  </h4></p>
  <h2>Sundarban</h2>

  <p><h4>The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world,
     stretching 80km (50mi) into the Bangladeshi hinterland from the coast.
      The forests aren't just mangrove swamps though, they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles 
      which once covered the Gangetic plain. The Sundarbans cover an area of 38,500 sq km,
     of which about one-third is covered in water.Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, 
     and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
    <br>
    Here land and water meet in many novel fashions, Wildlife presents many a spectacle. 
    No wonder, you may come across a Royal Bengal Tiger swimming across the streams or the crocodiles basking on the river banks.
     With the approach of the evening herds of deer make for the darking glades where boisterous monkeys shower Keora leaves from above for sumptuous meal for the former.
      For the botanist, the lover of nature, the poet and the painter this land provides a variety of wonder for which they all crave.

    It's beauty lies in its unique natural surrounding. 
    Thousands of meandering streams, creeks, rivers and estuaries have enhanced its charm.</h4></p>
