    <h2>Food Habit</h2>
    <img src="ilish.png" alt="Fish" class="center"></img>

  <P>
    <h4>A common saying goes,<b>“Fish and rice make a Bengali”</b>.  
    Fish from rivers are considered more flavorful than fish from the ocean. 
    A wide assortment of greens, fruits, and vegetables flourish in every season.
    Because the majority population is Muslim, beef, chicken, and goat are eaten, 
    but pork is not.</h4>
</P>

<h2>Dining Etiquette</h2>
<p>
    <h4>If invited to a meal, it is considered rude to turn the invitation down. 
    If you are unable to attend, express that indirectly to suggest it may be difficult,
    for example, “I will try,” can be an acceptable response if you cannot accept immediately.
    <br>Guests are generally served first, then the oldest, continuing in order of seniority.
    Do not begin eating until the oldest person at the table starts.  
    Ensure you wash your hands before eating. Even so, 
    the left hand is considered unclean, so only eat, pass dishes, 
     or drink with the right hand.</h4>

<h4> Celebrations are considered incomeplete without the delicious foods.
    Rather than served all at once,
     each dish is eaten separately with a little rice or flatbread so that the individual flavors can be enjoyed.
<br>
You will be constantly urged to take more food, 
so pace yourself so you can consume more servings. “I’m full,” 
is only considered a polite gesture and you will be expected to eat more.</h4>
